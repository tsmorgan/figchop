# figchop
Node code to chop tall images into 4000px chunks so they don't get resized when importing into Figma.

# background 
Figma seems to only be able to import files that are 4000px in any direction. I tend to want to drag screengrabs of an existing website into it so I can monkey with them to present new designs. So I need to quickly chop files that are mostly taller than 4000px into chunk that I can individiually drag into Figma and recombine without losing quality.
